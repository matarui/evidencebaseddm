This is the home of the course <a href="https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/home?id=245248"><b>Evidence-based Decision Making</b></a>, FS2020, at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel.
<br><br>
The behavioral sciences, such as psychology and economics, have developed a number of techniques to gain insights from empirical evidence to help individuals, groups, and policy makers make better decisions in disparate domains, including management, marketing, and health-care. 
This course aims to provide a general introduction to evidence-based decision making, including some of the techniques that have emerged in the past years to help decision makers make informed choices.
