## Exercise 2 (deadline May 26)
*Literature Search: Can psychological science contribute to fighting the corona crisis?*

Some of my psychologist friends and I recently tried to make the point that psychological science has something to offer during the corona crisis <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/63e601c8"><b>here</b></a> and you can find many more (and better) examples online these days. I would like to challenge you to answer this question yourself. 

Conduct a literature search on <a href="http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=n&CSC=Y&PAGE=main&D=psyh"><b>PsycInfo</b></a>. Pick any topic of interest to you that you feel would represent a good example of how psychological science could help during (or after) the corona epidemic. Identify peer-reviewed empirical papers or meta-analyses. 

If you are not familiar with PsycInfo, watch the following videos on <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/ec852f97"><b>searching</b></a> and <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/9c68f8ce"><b>exporting</b></a> results. 

Send me a description of your topic of interest, the keyword(s) you used, a screenshot of your PsycInfo search screen ("Suchverlauf"), and your export file as an Excel file to rui.mata at unibas.ch by May 26. 

## Exercise 3 (deadline May 26)

*Communicating the importance of evidence-based decision making*

Please provide your own answer to the question "Can psychological science contribute to fighting the corona crisis?" in the form of a blog post (max 300 words) or video (max 3 minutes) aimed at a general audience (bibliographic references do not count towards the word or time limit). Focus on a specific area or concrete example of how psychological science can help either understand or intervene in the current situation. You could focus on the result(s) you obtained from Exercise 2 (see above) or choose a different topic. The goal is not to express your own personal opinion but, rather, use  scientific evidence to discuss a specific aspect of human psychology and behavior that is relevant to the current crisis.  

Your contribution should include a reference to a meta-analysis or other empirical work (e.g., randomized control trial) that can substantiate your claims. You can complete this assignment individually or as a group (maximum 3 people). Your piece can be in either English, German, or Portuguese. 

Email your text or a link to your video to rui.mata at unibas.ch by May 26.
