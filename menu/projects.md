Conduct a literature search on <a href="http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=n&CSC=Y&PAGE=main&D=psyh"><b>PsycInfo</b></a>. Pick any topic of interest to you. Pick only peer-reviewed empirical papers published in the last 2 years (i.e., 2018, 2019, 2020). 

If you are not familiar with PsycInfo, watch the following videos on <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/ec852f97"><b>searching</b></a> and <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/9c68f8ce"><b>exporting</b></a> results. 

Send me a description of your topic of interest, the keyword(s) you used, a screenshot of your PsycInfo search screen ("Suchverlauf"), and your export file as an Excel file by May 12 (rui.mata at unibas.ch). 

## Exercise 5 (deadline May 26)

*Can psychological science contribute to fighting the corona crisis?* 

My friends and I recently tried to make the point that psychological science has something to offer during the corona crisis <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/63e601c8"><b>here</b></a> and you can find many more (and better) examples online these days. I would like to challenge you to answer this question yourself. 

Please provide your own answer to the question "Can psychological science contribute to fighting the corona crisis?" in the form of a blog post (max 300 words) or video (max 3 minutes) aimed at a general audience. Focus on a specific area or concrete example of how psychological science can help either understand or intervene in the current situation. The goal is not to express your own personal opinion but, rather, use current scientific evidence to discuss a specific aspect of human psychology and behavior that is relevant to the current crisis.  

Your contribution should include a reference to a meta-analysis or other empirical work (e.g., randomized control trial) that can substantiate your claims. You can complete this assignment individually or as a group (maximum 3 people). 

Email your text or a link to your video to rui.mata at unibas.ch by May 26 at the latest.
