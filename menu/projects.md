Can psychological science contribute to fighting the corona crisis? 

Many psychologists think this is the case. My friends and I tried to make this point <a href="https://tube.switch.ch/videos/63e601c8"><b>here</b></a> but you can find many more (and probably better) examples online. 

Please provide your answer in the form of a blog post (max 300 words) or video (max 3 minutes). Your contribution should include a reference to a meta-analysis or other empirical work (e.g., randomized control trial).
