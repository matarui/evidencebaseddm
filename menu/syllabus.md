## Grading and Exam
Students grades will be a combination of a) three homework assignments (30% of the final grade) and b) performance on a multiple-choice exam (70% of the final grade).

### Homework assignments
Three homework assignments will be given in class and will include conducting simple statistical analyses (e.g., regression), responding to an online quiz, or conducting a short literature search. Two of these assignments will substitute classrom sessions (April 7, May 5). 

### Exam
The exam will consist of circa 25 K-prim multiple-choice questions: Each question or incomplete statement is followed by four possible responses or statements. For each response or statement, a decision must be made as to whether it is right or wrong. Regardless of whether the question is grammatically formulated in the singular or the plural, one, two, three, four or even none of the answers may be correct. For each question, four correct answers equal 1 point, three correct equal .5 point, and less than 3 correct answers equal 0 points. 

The exam will be in English. Students are allowed to bring a dictionary to the exam.
